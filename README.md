There are two demos on Vimeo:https://vimeo.com/319290748/   https://vimeo.com/319291596/
If you need to initialize weights and smooth weights, you need to download CGAL and boost and then add "#define WITHCGAL" in the skincmd.h file.Otherwise, you will not have the initial weights to create skin and the smooth weight function cannot be used
